## About

PremiScale makes services typically only seen in cloud-native solutions more accessible to entities that cannot move to the cloud and must continue to manage their own physical and virtual infrastructure. PremiScale aims to support projects that scale or accelerate development and deployment in colocated, self-hosted and local development environments.
