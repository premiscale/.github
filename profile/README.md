# About

PremiScale's mission as a company and organization is to make services typically only seen in public cloud offerings more accessible to entities that cannot move to the cloud and must continue to manage their own physical and virtual infrastructure. PremiScale aims to support projects that scale and accelerate development and deployment to colocated, self-hosted and local development environments.
